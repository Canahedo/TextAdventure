You find yourself standing in front of a house, long since abandoned,
and nudge a pile of rolled up newspapers with your foot. 
They stopped delivering about a year ago.

In your hand you hold a letter. Fancy stationary, the kind
lawyers use to give bad news.

You never met Great-Uncle Henry, and your father didn't
talk about him much, but as his only living relative,
everything he had is now yours.

You look up at the cracked and grimy windows,
and sigh to yourself as you continue up the path.

Lucky you.
