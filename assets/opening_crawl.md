You find yourself standing in front of a house, long since abandoned,
and nudge a pile of rolled up newspapers with your foot. 
They stopped delivering about 10 years ago.

In your hand you hold the letter, and a key.

You never met Great-Uncle Henry. Your mother didn't
talk about him much, but as his only living relative,
everything he had is now yours.

You look up at the cracked and grimy windows,
and sigh to yourself as you continue up the path.

Lucky you.
